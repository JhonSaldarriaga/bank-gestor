# Bank Gestorüè¶

Bank Gestor is a program that allows you to manage the process of shifts and attention at the time of entry of a bank's clients, adding users in two rows, one of them with the characteristic of serving people with some priority. Once the user is served, it has 3 main functionalities that are, withdrawal / deposit, account cancellation and card payment. Finally, you also have the ability to store a database of the bank's users.

In this screen the two rows that our program has are available. To add a user you will have to press the "Add user" button and to attend it you will have to select depending on which row you want to attend first. If you want to attend from the normal row, you only have to press the "Attend" button and if you want to attend the priority row, you will have to press the "Attend Priority" button.

**User attention**

For attend user we have 3 functionalities there are:

- _Withdrawal/Consignment:_ This functionality modifies the amount of the savings account. Here you can select what you want to do, either withdraw or consign, once selected you must enter the value of the action you are going to perform. Finally, you will have to accept and the amount will be modified.

- _Cancel acount:_ This functionality allows you to delete the customer's data (customer database), and adds the data to another database (defector database) where it saves the date and the reason for the cancellation. To make the process effective, you must write the reason for the cancellation in the text box and accept it.

- _Card payment:_ This functionality allows you to pay the amount used with your credit card. This payment can be made in cash or by savings account. For this we have to specify what the payment method will be and once chosen it is given in the "Pay" button
